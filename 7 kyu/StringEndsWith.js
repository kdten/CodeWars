// String ends with?


// Instructions

// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return True if you're better, else False!

// Note:
// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!


// My Solution

function solution(str, ending){
    return str.endsWith(ending);
  }

// Best Practice

function solution(str, ending){
    return str.endsWith(ending);
  }

const solution = (str, ending) => str.endsWith(ending);
